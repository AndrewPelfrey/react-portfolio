                <p>
                Outside of coding, I enjoy spending time with friends
                and following sports. In my free time, I love to 
                dive into new things and learn new things.
                I find it very rewarding to solve problems and
                help others along the way.  
                Whether itâ€™s through coding, collaborating with others, or 
                diving into something new, I strive for growth and continuous
                improvement.
